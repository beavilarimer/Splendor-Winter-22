# Winter-22-Project
Implementing a board game from scratch using java

I had a lot of free time over break and decided to refresh my Java/oop knowledge
Implementing the player, card, noble, and deck classes was a lot of fun. I had 
to thrink thru the design process to make the integration easier.

I think throuhout the process I struggled trying to optimize too early as I was
coding which led to some roadblocks and reworks along the way.
